Remember, anyone who uses this bulletin board will be required to abide by its rules, but they must do the work of proving they satisfied the contract. When they make changes to the bulletin board, they submit proofs that they followed the rules, and observers can quickly verify their proofs. Such proofs, which observers can verify without access to the data that enabled the proof construction, are called zero-knowledge proofs, and they are implemented using mathematical circuits.

These ideas are not at all new; some of the important papers about zero-knowledge proofs were published in the 1980s. The more recent developments are advances in the way such proofs can be generated and verified automatically, without human intervention, and the way they can be combined with public blockchains.

QUESTION: when a dapp user makes a transaction, is it written on chain that this wallet made this transaction ?

On Midnight, transactions are handled differently than on traditional public blockchains. When a user makes a transaction through a DApp on Midnight, their wallet address and transaction details are not necessarily exposed on the public ledger.

Midnight uses zero-knowledge proofs (specifically zkSNARKs) to protect user privacy. Instead of recording the wallet address that made a transaction, Midnight's transactions embed cryptographic proofs that attest to the validity of an action without revealing sensitive data like the sender's identity [Learn > Understanding Midnight's Technology](https://docs.midnight.network/learn/understanding-midnights-technology/).

As explained in the documentation:

> Most transactions on Midnight are unsigned and adhere to a format defined by the Midnight Ledger itself. Rather than relying on traditional signature-based authorization, these transactions embed a cryptographic proof that attests to the validity of a specific action. [Develop > Nodes-and-dapps > Transactions](https://docs.midnight.network/develop/nodes-and-dapps/transactions)

Midnight supports "shielded" transactions, where:

> Wallet addresses and transaction details are not disclosed to counterparties or made available on a public ledger. [Learn > Glossary](https://docs.midnight.network/learn/glossary#shielded)

This privacy-preserving approach allows users to conduct transactions without exposing their identity or transaction details on-chain. The blockchain verifies that the transaction is valid through the zero-knowledge proof, but doesn't need to know who specifically initiated it.

This is a key difference from traditional blockchains where all transaction details, including wallet addresses, are publicly visible to anyone examining the ledger.
